# Brain Tumor Detection and Classification Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans. By utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model aims to assist in early diagnosis and improve healthcare decision-making.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing:** Cleaning, resizing, and augmenting MRI scan images.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Uses CNN architecture to classify brain tumor images.
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for dataset insights.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and model performance visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled MRI images categorized as:
- **Yes:** Images with brain tumors.
- **No:** Images without brain tumors.
